        <div class="my-title"> Modal Control of a Satellite </div>

        <div><img src="img/LQBF.png" class="image"></div>

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        This project aims to model the physical behavior of a true satellite and to generate robust control laws for AOCS. In addition to the central body and the solar panels, the satellite is composed of 4 long flexible appendices oriented in different directions and fixed at different positions distinct from the center of gravity.
      </br> </br>
        During the mission, four different modes with specific requirements can be operated: acquisition and safehold mode, coarse transition mode, normal mode and orbit control mode. The scientific mission is performed during the normal mode. It requires accurate pointing and therefore a particularly high level of performance and robustness of the AOCS.

      </br></br>
        The objectives of the project are threefold:
        <div class="list">
        <ul>
          <li> implement a realistic model of the satellite including actuator, sensor and estimator,
          <li> design control laws to ensure a fine pointing during normal operation,
          <li> validate the stability and the performance properties of the controlled system.
        </ul>
      </div>



        <h1>General Idea</h1>
        The main idea of the Modal control is to design the time response of the system. In order to do so, we have to choose the poles of the close-loop system in the complex plan and compute feedback corresponding to these poles.
      </br > We can choose how we place the poles thanks to their frequency and damping.


        <h1>Implementing the Modal approach on Matlab</h1>
        First, we start by importing our Simulink model of the satellite:
        <pre><code>
sys=linmod('PP');
sys=ss(sys.a,sys.b,sys.c,sys.d);
        </code></pre>
Then we set up different values of the frequency:
        <pre><code>
omega = [0.1 0.05 0.02];
delta = 0.7
        </code></pre>

Finally, we define and test the state feedback controller with different combinations of the previous parameters.
        <pre><code>
for i=1:3
    lambda = [-1 ; roots([1 2*delta*omega(i) omega(i)^2])]

    VW1 = null([sys.a-lambda(1)*eye(3) sys.b]);
    VW2 = null([sys.a-lambda(2)*eye(3) sys.b]);
    VW3 = null([sys.a-lambda(3)*eye(3) sys.b]);
    Kint = -real([VW1(4) VW2(4) VW3(4)]*inv(sys.c*[VW1(1:3) VW2(1:3) VW3(1:3)]))

    hy = 1;
    sys_closed_loop = linmod(tt);
    sys_closed_loop = ss(sys_closed_loop.a, sys_closed_loop.b,sys_closed_loop.c, sys_closed_loop.d);
    hy = inv(dcgain(sys_closed_loop(1,1)));

    t = 0:0.01:tend;
    step= 3*pi/180*ones(size(t'));
    [t,X,y] = sim(tt,tend,[],[t' step]);

    subplot(2,1,1)
    plot(t,y(:,1),cc(1),'MarkerSize',1,'LineWidth',1)
    hold on

    title('Angle (rad)');

    subplot(2,1,2)
    plot(t,y(:,2),cc(1),'MarkerSize',1,'LineWidth',1)
    hold on
    title('Command signal (~Power)');

end
        </code></pre>




        <h1>Results</h1>
        <img src="img/Modal.png" class="image">
        As we can see, the results are consistent with what was expected: when we increase the frequency, the system is faster,
        the gains are more important and the energy used is also more important. Moreover, in this case we have chosen a damping factor
        of 0.7 which is the best tradeoff between speed and overshooting. As expected, the system overshoot a little but it allows it to be faster.
